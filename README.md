# Find-Alternate-Products
**Solution to the question [Help shoppers find product â€œalternates](https://laser-comb-669.notion.site/Help-shoppers-find-product-alternates-2eec9b82b7c14c9eb849f481db83a14e)**

For this solution, I have used `json` to work with JSON data and `requests` to make HTTP requests to retrieve product data.

    FindAlternateGroups() returns all the product alternate arrays having alternate options in size, print or color.

    FindAlternateGroups_color() returns only those product alternate arrays that have options in color and print.
